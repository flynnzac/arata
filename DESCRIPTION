Title: Manipulates Datasets and Performs Regressions Using A Command-on-Data Syntax
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Zach", "Flynn", email = "zlflynn@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package implements tools for manipulating data sets and performing regressions in a way that is familiar to users of a popular, but proprietary, statistical package commonly used in the social sciences. That package works by executing commands on a given dataset loaded into memory.  This package is similarly a "command-on-data" enviroment, an alternative to standard R's more function-based approach.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.1.0)
