Revision: 

- Added examples for any function missing one which should hopefully make it clearer how the functions work.
- Added a return value for all functions that didn't have one documented. Many functions in the package only return NULL, invisibly. They are more "commands" than functions.
- Added more error checking and a couple convenience functions
